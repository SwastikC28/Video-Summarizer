The first thing you need to know is that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic. It follows all the rules of arithmetic and it uses the same four main operations that arithmetic is built on: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. When you were learning arithmetic, the only thing that was ever unknown was the answer to the problem. Now the important thing about Algebra is that when we don't know what a number is yet, we use a symbol in its place. So in arithmetic, we would just leave the problem like this: 1 + 2 = \"blank\" and we'd write in the answer when we did the addition. But in Algebra, we'd write it like this:  1 + 2 = x The 'x' is a place holder that stands for the number that we don't know yet. One of the main goals in Algebra is to figure out what the unknown values in equations are. In this equation, it's pretty easy to see that the unknown value is just 3. And that's why in Algebra, you are usually given an equation in a more complicated form like this: x - 2 = 1. So in Algebra, solving equations is a lot like a game where you are given mixed-up, complicated equations, and it's your job to simplify them and rearrange them until it is a nice simple equation (like x = 3) where it's easy to tell what the unknown values are. We're going to learn a lot more about how you actually do that (how you solve equations) in the next several videos, but for now, let's learn some important rules about how symbols can and can't be used in algebraic equations. The first rule you need to know is that the same symbol (or letter) can be used in different algebra problems to stand for different unknown values. For example, in the problem we just solved, the letter 'x' was used to stand for the number 3, right? But 'x' could stand for a different number in a different problem. In order for the two sides of this equation to be equal, 'x' must have the value '5' in this problem, because 5 + 5 = 10. So 'x' (or any other symbol) can stand for different values in different problems. That's okay, but what's NOT okay is for a symbol to stand for different values in the same problem at the same time! And there are a lot of different numbers we could add together to get 10, like 6 and 4. But, if we had the first 'x' stand for 6 and the second 'x' stand for 4, then 'x' would stand for two different value at the same time and things could get really confusing! If you wanted symbols to stand for two different numbers at the same time, you would need to use two different symbols, like 'x' and 'y'. So in Algebra, whenever you see the same symbol repeated more than once in an equation, it's representing the same unknown value. Like if you see a really complicated Algebraic equation (like this), where 'x' is repeated a lot of different times, all of those 'x's stand for the same value, and it will be your job to figure out what that value is. Okay, so for any particular equation, we can't use the same letter to represent two different numbers at the same time, but what about the other way around? Could we use two different letters to represent the same number? Oh, and this problem can help us understand something very important about how symbols are used in Algebra. In Algebra, 'b' is what's called a \"variable\" because it's value can 'vary' or change. Actually, it's really common in Algebra to refer to any letter as a variable, since letters can stand for different values in different problems. But at Math Antics, we'll usually just use the word \"variable\" when we're talking about values that can change or vary in the same problem. Alright, so far we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but that in includes unknown values and variables that we can solve for in equations. There's one other really important thing that I want to teach you that will help you understand what's going on in a lot of Algebra problems, and it has to do with multiplication. In Arithmetic, all four operations have the same status, but in Algebra, multiplication get's some special treatment. That means, if no other arithmetic operation is shown between two symbols, then you can just assume they're being multiplied. The advantage of this rule about multiplication is that it makes many algebraic equations less cluttered and easier to write down. You can also use this shorthand when you are multiplying a variable and a known number... like 2x, which means the same thing as 2 times 'x' or 3y which means the same thing as 3 times 'y' Since the symbol and the number are right next to each other, the multiplication is implied. there are some cases in Algebra where still need to use a multiplication symbol. If you just get rid of the times symbol and put the '2' right next to the '5', it's going to look like the two-digit number twenty-five, which is NOT the same as 2 x 5. So, whenever you need to show multiplication between two known numbers, you still have to use the times symbol, unless... We could put a times symbol between the groups, but we don't have to because it's the default operation in Algebra. So, going back to our problem: 2 x 5 If you wanted to, you could put each of the numbers inside parentheses like this, and then you could get rid of the multiplication sign. Now this can't be confused with the number twenty-five, and since the groups are right next to each other, you know that you need to multiply them. Of course, it might seem strange to have just one thing inside 'group' symbols like this, but it's okay to do that in math. An alternate way that you could do the same thing would be to put just one of the numbers in parentheses, like this. Okay, so we've learned that Algebra is a lot like arithmetic, but it involves unknown values or variables that we need to solve for. And we learned that in Algebra, the multiplication sign is usually not shown, because it's the default operation. Actually, Algebra is very useful for describing or \"modeling\"  things in the real world. Graphing an equation is like using its different solutions to draw simple lines and curves that can be used to describe and predict things in real life.","sentence_original":120,"sentence_summary":46},"success":true}
